# AI Literacy

This repository supports researchers and educators in understanding, evaluating, and responsibly integrating artificial intelligence into academic work.  
It provides conceptual grounding, ethical guidance, and practical examples to strengthen AI literacy and critical engagement across disciplines.

AI is now embedded in research methods, writing, and communication.  Goal of this project is to help the university community:
- Understand how AI systems work and what they can (and cannot) do  
- Integrate AI tools into research design and analysis responsibly  
- Evaluate accuracy, bias, and interpretability in AI-assisted research  
- Apply ethical and privacy frameworks, including FERPA and NIST AI Risk Management Framework
